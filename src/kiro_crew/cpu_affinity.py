backend factory, and the STT engine, whose own module imports ``numpy`` at module

    the latter reports the whole machine, which is exactly the environment that
    over-threads worst. Falls back to ``os.cpu_count`` where affinity is
    unavailable (macOS, Windows).

    A CPU **quota** -- ``docker run --cpus``, a Kubernetes ``limits.cpu``,

    under one reads the host's cores.

    ``None`` means no source could answer, and is deliberately not collapsed to
    1 so a caller can tell an unknown count from a one-core host -- what a
    drop-in replacement for ``os.cpu_count`` has to preserve.
